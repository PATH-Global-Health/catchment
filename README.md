## Installation

Before installing this package, first you will need to install the
[R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/home) and [Template Model Builder
(TMB)](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp) packages. These packages are not
on CRAN, and the installation process may depend on the type of computer
you are using. I recommend following the [installation instructions for
INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install) first, and then install
TMB. Be sure to close out of any active R session before installation!

The catchment package is also not on CRAN (yet!). You can install the
development version of catchment from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PATH-Global-Health/catchment")
```
