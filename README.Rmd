## Installation

Before installing this package, first you will need to install the [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/home) and [Template Model Builder (TMB)](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp) packages. These packages are not on CRAN, and the installation process may depend on the type of computer you are using. I recommend following the [installation instructions for INLA](<https://www.r-inla.org/download-install>) first, and then install TMB. Be sure to close out of any active R session before installation!

The catchment package is also not on CRAN (yet!). You can install the development version of catchment from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PATH-Global-Health/catchment")
```
